# MLB The Show Franchise Manager 1.0

> Franchise manager for MLB The Show Franchise Mode video game

This is a web application that allows users to manage their franchise or their roster when playing MLB The Show Franchise Mode. The inspiration for this web application is player progression and regression. If you've been playing the game for so long, you'll know that there is no way for you to check the trail of your individual player.

With this application, you'll be able to see how a particular player did progress or regress, you'll see his Overall, Performance and other information from previous years.

Note that this is still under development. Now, why would I create this application? I've been playing this game since 2004, I am a huge MLB fan and MLB The Show fan. Franchise Mode is one of my favorites and I know exactly what I can't do with the game and what I need from the game. So I am addressing it. :)
